Anope is a set of IRC Services forked from Epona early 2003 to pick up where
Epona had been abandoned. Ever since there have been improvements on quality
and functionality of Anope, resulting in the feature rich set of services we
offer today.

	NickServ - nickname management services. NickServ allows your users to
	register their nickname to prevent others from stealing their nickname.
	Your users will also be able to kill any ghost connections with their
	nickname and will be able to group their most-used nicknames together so
	they can use the same set of settings and access for all of their
	nicknames.

	ChanServ - channel management services. ChanServ provides the ability to
	register your channels. This way ChanServ can be used to give channel
	operator status to regular operators, or to lock other modes or a topic for
	your channel. Our version of ChanServ provides a very complete set of
	features for channel management, allowing complete control over your
	channel.

	MemoServ - send memos to users or channels. MemoServ offers a way to send
	short messages to users who are currently offline, or to entire channels if
	you wish.  This allows you and your users to quickly tell offline users
	something, without a chance of forgetting it.

	OperServ - operator utility services. OperServ provides a very complete set
	of functionality for IRC Operators, allowing them to operate their network
	in a very efficient way. Including often used features like akills and
	session limiting, this black box for IRC Operators ensures a safe and easy
	to manage IRC network.

	BotServ - channel bot services. BotServ allows you to create several bots
	for your network. These bots can join channels and take over most actions
	from ChanServ, making things just a tad more intuitive. Additionally,
	BotServ also adds a few features like fantasy commands and kick triggers.

	HostServ - virtual host services. HostServ offers a way to easily provide
	virtual hosts to the users on your network. If your IRCd supports virtual
	hosts HostServ can be used as a very easy interface for setting them, and
	enables the virtual host every time a user joins the network.

Next to these popular services, Anope also provides a few other services. These
include HelpServ, a service used to give people a simple overview of services,
DevNull, a message sink, and Global, used to send global notices to everyone on
your IRC network.

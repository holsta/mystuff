insobot is an extensible IRC bot built on a module/plugin architecture;
its functionality is split into separate shared objects that are
dynamically loaded and hot-reloaded on the fly. 

Written in C, it aims to have a low resource footprint suited for
running on small Linux devices such as the Raspberry Pi.

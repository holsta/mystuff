Timewarrior is a command line time tracking application, which allows you to
record time spent on activities. You may be tracking your time for curiosity,
or because your work requires it.

Timewarrior records time, and associates blocks of time with tags. The recorded
data can be exposed as JSON for any app to consume.

Built-in reports, as well as a set of extension reports will give you plenty of
options, in addition to customizing your time reporting using any programming
language. There will be a collection of reports and extensions to download and
use.

A Taskwarrior (productivity/taskwarrior) hook script provides integration with
the matching start and stop commands, thereby enabling proper time tracking for
Taskwarrior users.

Databases
=========
Roundup supports a number of databases as back-ends. SQLite works by
default which should be fine for testing and smaller installations.

In addition, this port comes with a flavour to support PostgreSQL.

Tracker location
================
The tracker lives in ${HOMEDIR}. First, install the config and HTML
files and answer questions about path, template and database backend:

    alias ra=sudo -u _roundup roundup-admin
    ra install ${HOMEDIR}

Then, initialise the database:

    ra init ${HOMEDIR}
